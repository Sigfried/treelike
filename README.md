### TreeLike Data Browser for CSV or JSON files from SQL queries or spreadsheets

[Demo](../treelike/demo.html) (you'll need a data file, how about: [MySQL world data](https://raw.github.com/Sigfried/treelike/master/data/mysql_world_data.csv))

TreeLike is an experimental tool providing a quick way to understand the
shape of the data in a CSV file (or a spreadsheet or SQL query or SAS
data set, or any other data arranged in rows and columns and saved as
CSV or JSON.)

It immediately shows the distributions of values in all columns, and by
laying out the columns in some nesting order, can show hierarchical
relationships between values across columns. When two columns have a
many-to-many relationship, the merge feature shows connections in both
directions, not just from parent to child. And parent/child
relationships can be reordered with one or two mouse clicks.

To understand what it does, you need to see it in action. This rough
demo video will explain:
